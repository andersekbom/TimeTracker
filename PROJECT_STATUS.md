## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### First-Time Setup
1. **Power Device** → Automatic BLE setup mode (blue LED)
2. **Install Mobile App** → Download APK or build from source
3. **Connect & Configure** → WiFi credentials + Toggl settings via app
4. **Start Tracking** → Rotate cube to switch between projects

### Daily Operation
- **Orientation Changes** → Automatic project switching
- **Visual Feedback** → LED shows current project/status
- **Background Sync** → Automatic Toggl API updates
- **Power Cycling** → Configuration persists across restarts
