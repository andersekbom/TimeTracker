# BLE Configuration Implementation Status

## üéØ Implementation Complete - Ready for Production Testing

### ‚úÖ Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. **Base64 Encoding Mismatch (CRITICAL FIX)**
- **Problem**: Mobile app sent base64-encoded data, Arduino read as raw text
- **Impact**: All WiFi credentials and Toggl tokens were corrupted
- **Solution**: Added base64 decoding to all Arduino BLE handlers
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All credentials now decoded correctly

#### 2. **Token Length Truncation**
- **Problem**: ConfigStorage buffer too small (128 chars vs 256 char BLE limit)
- **Impact**: Long Toggl tokens were truncated, causing API authentication failures
- **Solution**: Increased ConfigStorage buffer to 256 characters
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Full token length preserved

#### 3. **BLE Reconnection Issues**
- **Problem**: Device name became "null" after first disconnect
- **Impact**: Reconnection impossible without manual re-scanning
- **Solution**: Added device name preservation and disconnect detection
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Reconnection works seamlessly

#### 4. **Configuration Mode Limitations**
- **Problem**: Device stopped BLE after first configuration (one-time setup)
- **Impact**: Device not reconfigurable without factory reset
- **Solution**: Implemented dual-mode (BLE + WiFi simultaneous operation)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Always-configurable device
