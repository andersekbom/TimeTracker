# TimeTracker BLE Security Implementation

## Overview
TimeTracker implements multiple layers of BLE security to prevent unauthorized device connections and protect configuration data from malicious devices.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Custom Service UUID Authentication ✅ IMPLEMENTED
The system uses a unique 128-bit service UUID that prevents device spoofing:

**Device firmware (SimpleBLEConfig.cpp:58-60):**
```cpp
// Custom service UUID specifically for TimeTracker authentication
#define TIMETRACKER_SERVICE_UUID "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4789-abcd-123456789abc"
```

**Mobile app (BLEService.ts:110-111):**
```typescript
// Only scan for devices advertising our specific service UUID
this.manager.startDeviceScan(
  [TIMETRACKER_SERVICE_UUID],
  { allowDuplicates: false },
  // ...
);
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Only authentic TimeTracker devices can be discovered during scanning
- Prevents accidental connections to other BLE devices
- Device name is not used for authentication (prevents name-based spoofing)
- UUID collision probability is negligible (2^-128)

### 2. Service Discovery Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Additional validation ensures only devices with the correct service structure are accepted:

**Device firmware (SimpleBLEConfig.cpp:318-355):**
```cpp
// Complete service setup with all required characteristics
configService = new BLEService(TIMETRACKER_SERVICE_UUID);
wifiSSIDChar = new BLEStringCharacteristic(WIFI_SSID_CHAR_UUID, BLERead | BLEWrite, 128);
// ... other characteristics
BLE.addService(*configService);
BLE.setAdvertisedService(*configService);
```

**Mobile app (BLEService.ts:166-167):**
```typescript
// Discover and verify service structure after connection
await this.device.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics();
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Verifies device has the complete expected service structure
- Prevents connection to devices with incomplete or malicious service implementations
- Ensures all required characteristics are present before data transmission

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 3. Challenge-Response Authentication (Future Enhancement)
For even stronger security, implement a cryptographic handshake after connection:

**Arduino firmware:**
```cpp
// Store a pre-shared key or use asymmetric crypto
const uint8_t deviceSecret[16] = {0x12, 0x34, ...}; // Your secret

void handleAuthChallenge(uint8_t* challenge, uint8_t challengeLen) {
    // Generate response using HMAC-SHA256 or similar
    uint8_t response[32];
    generateHMACResponse(challenge, challengeLen, deviceSecret, response);
    authCharacteristic.writeValue(response, 32);
}
```

**App side:**
```kotlin
// After connecting, send random challenge
val challenge = ByteArray(16)
SecureRandom().nextBytes(challenge)
challengeCharacteristic.writeValue(challenge)

// Verify the device's response matches expected value
val expectedResponse = generateExpectedHMAC(challenge, sharedSecret)
if (!Arrays.equals(deviceResponse, expectedResponse)) {
    disconnect() // Not a legitimate device
}
```

## 3. Certificate-Based Authentication
For stronger security, use digital certificates:

- Embed a unique certificate in each device's firmware
- Have your app verify the certificate against a trusted root CA
- This prevents cloning even if someone extracts your firmware

## 4. Firmware Version Verification
Add a characteristic that reports firmware version and build signature:

```cpp
// Include in your firmware
const char* firmwareVersion = "1.2.3-abc123def";
const uint8_t buildSignature[32] = {...}; // Hash of your build
```

## 5. Enhanced Device Scanning
Modify your scanning logic to be more restrictive:

```kotlin
private fun isLegitimateDevice(device: BluetoothDevice, scanRecord: ScanRecord): Boolean {
    // Check 1: Correct service UUID present
    if (!scanRecord.serviceUuids?.contains(ParcelUuid.fromString(CUSTOM_SERVICE_UUID))) {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check 2: Manufacturer data contains expected signature
    val manufacturerData = scanRecord.getManufacturerSpecificData(COMPANY_ID)
    if (!verifyManufacturerData(manufacturerData)) {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check 3: Device name follows exact expected pattern
    return device.name?.matches(Regex("YourPrefix-[A-F0-9]{8}")) == true
}
```

## 6. Connection Timeout and Behavior Analysis
Implement behavioral checks:

```kotlin
// Set short timeout for authentication
private val AUTH_TIMEOUT_MS = 3000L

private fun authenticateDevice(gatt: BluetoothGatt) {
    startAuthTimeout()
    
    // Legitimate devices should respond to auth challenge quickly
    // Malicious devices might hang or respond incorrectly
}
```

## 7. Secure Manufacturer Data
Include signed data in BLE advertisements:

**Arduino:**
```cpp
// Create signed advertisement data
uint8_t advData[20];
memcpy(advData, deviceId, 8);
memcpy(advData + 8, timestamp, 4);
memcpy(advData + 12, signature, 8); // HMAC of deviceId + timestamp

BLEAdvertisingData bleAdvData;
bleAdvData.setManufacturerData(COMPANY_ID, advData, 20);
```

## Implementation Priority:
1. **Start with custom service UUID** - easiest to implement, big security improvement
2. **Add challenge-response authentication** - prevents connection to unauthorized devices
3. **Implement manufacturer data verification** - catches fakes during scanning
4. **Consider certificates for production** - highest security but more complex

## Additional Security Measures:
- Use encrypted characteristics for sensitive data
- Implement connection attempt rate limiting
- Log and monitor unusual connection patterns
- Consider requiring user confirmation for new device pairings

This layered approach makes it extremely difficult for malicious devices to successfully impersonate your legitimate hardware, while still maintaining reasonable usability for your application.
